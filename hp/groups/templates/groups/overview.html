<p>{% blocktrans %}This app allows you to manage shared roster groups.
These groups have owners and members.
It is possible to own a group without being a member of it
and (most importantly) it is possible to be a member of a group owned by somebody else.
All group members have each other automatically on their roster (i.e. contact list)
and are subscribed to each other's presence (i.e. online status).
You can leave groups at any time.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
